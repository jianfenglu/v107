title: Exact asymptotics for phase retrieval and compressed sensing with random generative
  priors
abstract: 'We consider the problem of compressed sensing and of (real-valued) phase
  retrieval with random measurement matrix.  We derive sharp asymptotics for the information-theoretically
  optimal performance and for the best known polynomial algorithm for an ensemble
  of generative priors consisting of fully connected deep neural networks with random
  weight matrices and arbitrary activations.  We compare the performance to sparse
  separable priors and conclude that in all cases analysed generative priors have
  a smaller statistical-to-algorithmic gap than sparse priors, giving theoretical
  support to previous experimental observations that generative priors might be advantageous
  in terms of algorithmic performance.  In particular, while sparsity does not allow
  to perform compressive phase retrieval efficiently close to its information-theoretic
  limit, it is found that under the random generative prior compressed phase retrieval
  becomes tractable. '
