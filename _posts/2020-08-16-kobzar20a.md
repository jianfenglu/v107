title: New Potential-Based Bounds for the Geometric-Stopping Version of Prediction
  with Expert Advice
abstract: 'This work addresses the classic machine learning problem of online prediction
  with expert advice. A new potential-based framework for the fixed horizon version
  of this problem has been recently developed using verification arguments from optimal
  control theory. This paper extends this framework to the random (geometric) stopping
  version.  To obtain explicit bounds, we construct potentials for the geometric version
  from potentials used for the fixed horizon version of the problem. This construction
  leads to new explicit lower and upper bounds associated with specific adversary
  and player strategies. While there are several known lower bounds in the fixed horizon
  setting, our lower bounds appear to be the first such results in the geometric stopping
  setting with an arbitrary number of experts. Our framework also leads in some cases
  to improved upper bounds. For two and three experts, our bounds are optimal to leading
  order.  '
