title: Calibrating Multivariate Lévy Processes with Neural Networks
abstract: "  Calibrating a Lévy process usually requires characterizing its jump distribution.
  Traditionally this problem can be solved with nonparametric estimation using the
  empirical characteristic functions (ECF), assuming certain regularity, and results
  to date are mostly in 1D. For multivariate Lévy processes and less smooth Lévy densities,
  the problem becomes challenging as ECFs decay slowly and have large uncertainty
  because of limited observations. We solve this problem by approximating the Lévy
  density with a parametrized functional form; the characteristic function is then
  estimated using numerical integration. In our benchmarks, we used deep neural networks
  and found that they are robust and can capture sharp transitions in the Lévy density
  compared to piecewise linear functions and radial basis functions. "
