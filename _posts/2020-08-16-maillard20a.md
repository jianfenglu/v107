title: Landscape Complexity for the Empirical Risk of Generalized Linear Models
abstract: " We present a method to obtain the average and the typical value of the
  number of critical points of the empirical risk landscape for generalized linear
  estimation problems and variants.  This represents a substantial extension of previous
  applications of the Kac-Rice method since it allows to analyze the critical points
  of high dimensional non-Gaussian random functions. We obtain a rigorous explicit
  variational formula for the \\emph{annealed complexity}, which is the logarithm
  of the average number of critical points at fixed value of the empirical risk. This
  result is simplified, and extended, using the non-rigorous Kac-Rice replicated method
  from theoretical physics. In this way we find an explicit variational formula for
  the \\emph{quenched complexity}, which is generally different from its annealed
  counterpart, and allows to obtain the number of critical points for typical instances
  up to exponential accuracy.  "
