title: 'SchrödingerRNN: Generative modeling of raw audio as a continuously observed
  quantum state'
abstract: " We introduce SchrödingeRNN, a quantum-inspired generative model for raw
  audio. Audio data is wave-like and is sampled from a continuous signal. Although
  generative modeling of raw audio has made great strides lately, relational inductive
  biases relevant to these two characteristics are mostly absent from models explored
  to date.  Quantum Mechanics is a natural source of probabilistic models of wave
  behavior. Our model takes the form of a stochastic Schrödinger equation describing
  the continuous time measurement of a quantum system, and is equivalent to the \\textit{continuous
  Matrix Product State} (cMPS) representation of wavefunctions in one dimensional
  many-body systems. This constitutes a deep autoregressive architecture in which
  the system’s state is a latent representation of the past observations. We test
  our model on synthetic data sets of stationary and non-stationary signals. This
  is the first time cMPS are used in machine learning."
