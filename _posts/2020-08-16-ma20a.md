title: The Slow Deterioration of the Generalization Error of the Random Feature Model
abstract: 'The random feature model exhibits a kind of resonance behavior when the
  number of parameters is close to the training sample size. This behavior is characterized
  by the appearance of large generalization gap, and is due to the occurrence of very
  small eigenvalues for the associated Gram matrix. In this paper, we examine the
  dynamic behavior of the gradient descent algorithm in this regime. We show, both
  theoretically and experimentally, that there is a dynamic self-correction mechanism
  at work: The larger the eventual generalization gap, the slower it develops, both
  because of the small eigenvalues. This gives us ample time to stop the training
  process and obtain solutions with good generalization property. '
