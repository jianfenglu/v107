title: 'Butterfly-Net2: Simplified Butterfly-Net and Fourier Transform Initialization'
abstract: 'Structured CNN designed using the prior information of problems potentially
  improves efficiency over conventional CNNs in various tasks in solving PDEs and
  inverse problems in signal processing. This paper introduces BNet2, a simplified
  Butterfly-Net and inline with the conventional CNN.  Moreover, a Fourier transform
  initialization is proposed for both BNet2 and CNN with guaranteed approximation
  power to represent the Fourier transform operator. Experimentally, BNet2 and the
  Fourier transform initialization strategy are tested on various tasks, including
  approximating Fourier transform operator, end-to-end solvers of linear and nonlinear
  PDEs, and denoising and deblurring of 1D signals. On all tasks, under the same initialization,
  BNet2 achieves similar accuracy as CNN but has fewer parameters. And Fourier transform
  initialized BNet2 and CNN consistently improve the training and testing accuracy
  over the randomly initialized CNN.  '
