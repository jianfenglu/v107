title: Geometric Wavelet Scattering Networks  on Compact Riemannian Manifolds
abstract: "  The Euclidean scattering transform was introduced nearly a decade ago
  to improve the mathematical understanding of convolutional neural networks. Inspired
  by recent interest in geometric deep learning, which aims to generalize convolutional
  neural networks to manifold and graph-structured domains, we define a geometric
  scattering transform on manifolds. Similar to the Euclidean scattering transform,
  the geometric scattering transform is based on a cascade of wavelet filters and
  pointwise nonlinearities. It is invariant to local isometries and stable to certain
  types of diffeomorphisms. Empirical results demonstrate its utility on several geometric
  learning tasks. Our results generalize the deformation stability and local translation
  invariance of Euclidean scattering, and demonstrate the importance of linking the
  used filter structures to the underlying geometry of the data.  "
