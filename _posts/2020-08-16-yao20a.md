title: Policy Gradient based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
abstract: 'The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), as a hybrid quantum/classical
  algorithm, has received much interest recently. QAOA can also be viewed as a variational
  ansatz for quantum control.  However, its direct application to emergent quantum
  technology encounters additional physical constraints: (i) the states of the quantum
  system are not observable; (ii) obtaining the derivatives of the objective function
  can be computationally expensive or even inaccessible in experiments, and (iii)
  the values of the objective function may be sensitive to various sources of uncertainty,
  as is the case for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Taking such
  constraints into account, we show that policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning
  (RL) algorithms are well suited for optimizing the variational parameters of QAOA
  in a noise-robust fashion, opening up the way for developing RL techniques for continuous
  quantum control. This is advantageous to help mitigate and monitor the potentially
  unknown sources of errors in modern quantum simulators.  We analyze the performance
  of the algorithm for quantum state transfer problems in single- and multi-qubit
  systems, subject to various sources of noise such as error terms in the Hamiltonian,
  or quantum uncertainty in the measurement process. We show that, in noisy setups,
  it is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art existing optimization algorithms. '
