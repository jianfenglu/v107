title: Deep learning Markov and Koopman models with physical constraints
abstract: 'The long-timescale behavior of complex dynamical systems can be described
  by linear Markov or Koopman models in a suitable latent space. Recent variational
  approaches allow the latent space representation and the linear dynamical model
  to be optimized via unsupervised machine learning methods. Incorporation of physical
  constraints such as time-reversibility or stochasticity into the dynamical model
  has been established for a linear, but not for arbitrarily nonlinear (deep learning)
  representations of the latent space. Here we develop theory and methods for deep
  learning Markov and Koopman models that can bear such physical constraints.  We
  prove that the model is an universal approximator for reversible Markov processes
  and that it can be optimized with either maximum likelihood or the variational approach
  of Markov processes (VAMP).  We demonstrate that the model performs equally well
  for equilibrium and systematically better for biased data compared to existing approaches,
  thus providing a tool to study the long-timescale processes of dynamical systems.  '
