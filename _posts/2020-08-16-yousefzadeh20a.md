title: 'Deep learning interpretation: Flip points and homotopy methods'
abstract: 'Deep learning models are complicated mathematical functions, and their
  interpretation remains a challenging research question. We formulate and solve optimization
  problems to answer questions about the models and their outputs. Specifically, we
  develop methods to study the decision boundaries of classification models using
  {\em flip points}. A flip point is any point that lies on the boundary between two
  output classes: e.g. for a neural network with a binary yes/no output, a flip point
  is any input that generates equal scores for “yes” and “no”. The flip point closest
  to a given input is of particular importance, and this point is the solution to
  a well-posed optimization problem. To compute the closest flip point, we develop
  a homotopy algorithm to overcome the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients
  and to find a feasible solution for our optimization problem. We show that computing
  closest flip points allows us to systematically investigate the model, identify
  decision boundaries, interpret and audit the model with respect to individual inputs
  and entire datasets, and find vulnerability against adversarial attacks. We demonstrate
  that flip points can help identify mistakes made by a model, improve the model’s
  accuracy, and reveal the most influential features for classifications.'
