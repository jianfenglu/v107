title: A type of generalization error induced by initialization in deep neural networks
abstract: " How initialization and loss function affect the learning of a deep neural
  network (DNN), specifically its generalization error, is an important problem in
  practice. In this work, by exploiting the linearity of DNN training dynamics in
  the NTK regime \\citep{jacot2018neural,lee2019wide}, we provide an explicit and
  quantitative answer to this problem. Focusing on regression problem, we prove that,
  in the NTK regime, for any loss in a general class of functions, the DNN finds the
  same \\emph{global} minimaâ€”the one that is nearest to the initial value in the parameter
  space, or equivalently, the one that is closest to the initial DNN output in the
  corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Using these optimization problems,
  we quantify the impact of initial output and prove that a random non-zero one increases
  the generalization error. We further propose an antisymmetrical initialization (ASI)
  trick that eliminates this type of error and accelerates the training. To understand
  whether the above results hold in general, we also perform experiments for DNNs
  in the non-NTK regime, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results
  and the ASI trick in a qualitative sense. Overall, our work serves as a baseline
  for the further investigation of the impact of initialization and loss function
  on the generalization of DNNs, which can potentially guide and improve the training
  of DNNs in practice.  "
