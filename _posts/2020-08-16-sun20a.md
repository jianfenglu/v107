title: 'NeuPDE: Neural Network Based Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations for
  Modeling Time-Dependent Data'
abstract: "  We propose a neural network based approach for extracting models from
  dynamic data using ordinary and partial differential equations. In particular, given
  a time-series or spatio-temporal dataset,  we seek to identify an accurate governing
  system which respects the intrinsic differential structure. The unknown governing
  model is parameterized by using both (shallow) multilayer perceptrons and nonlinear
  differential terms, in order to incorporate relevant correlations between spatio-temporal
  samples. We demonstrate the approach on several examples where the data is sampled
  from various dynamical systems and give a comparison to recurrent networks and other
  data-discovery methods. In addition, we show that for SVHN, MNIST, Fashion MNIST,
  and CIFAR10/100, our approach lowers the parameter cost as compared to other deep
  neural networks."
