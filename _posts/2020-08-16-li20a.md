title: 'Deep Domain Decomposition Method: Elliptic Problems'
abstract: 'This paper proposes a deep-learning-based domain decomposition method (DeepDDM),
  which leverages deep neural networks (DNN) to discretize the subproblems divided
  by domain decomposition methods (DDM) for solving partial differential equations
  (PDE).  Using DNN to solve PDE is a physics-informed learning problem with the objective
  involving two terms, domain term and boundary term, which respectively make the
  desired solution satisfy the PDE and corresponding boundary conditions. DeepDDM
  will exchange the subproblem information across the interface in DDM by adjusting
  the boundary term for solving each subproblem by DNN. Benefiting from the simple
  implementation and mesh-free strategy of using DNN for PDE, DeepDDM will simplify
  the implementation of DDM and make DDM more flexible for complex PDE, e.g., those
  with complex interfaces in the computational domain. This paper will firstly investigate
  the performance of using DeepDDM for elliptic problems, including a model problem
  and an interface problem.  The numerical examples demonstrate that DeepDDM exhibits
  behaviors consistent with conventional DDM: the number of iterations by DeepDDM
  is independent of network architecture and decreases with increasing overlapping
  size.  The performance of DeepDDM on elliptic problems will encourage us to further
  investigate its performance for other kinds of PDE and may provide new insights
  for improving the PDE solver by deep learning.  '
