title: Quantum Ground States from Reinforcement Learning
abstract: "  Finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical system can be formulated
  as an optimal control problem. In this formulation, the drift of the optimally controlled
  process is chosen to match the distribution of paths in the Feynman–Kac (FK) representation
  of the solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation. This provides a variational
  principle that can be used for reinforcement learning of a neural representation
  of the drift. Our approach is a drop-in replacement for path integral Monte Carlo,
  learning an optimal importance sampler for the FK trajectories. We demonstrate the
  applicability of our approach to several problems of one-, two-, and many-particle
  physics."
