title: 'Robust Training and Initialization of Deep Neural Networks: An Adaptive Basis
  Viewpoint'
abstract: 'Motivated by the gap between theoretical optimal approximation rates of
  deep neural networks (DNNs) and the accuracy realized in practice, we seek to improve
  the training of DNNs. The adoption of an adaptive basis viewpoint of DNNs leads
  to novel initializations and a hybrid least squares/gradient descent optimizer.
  We provide analysis of these techniques and illustrate via numerical examples dramatic
  increases in accuracy and convergence rate for benchmarks characterizing scientific
  applications where DNNs are currently used, including regression problems and physics-informed
  neural networks for the solution of partial differential equations. '
