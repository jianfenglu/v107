title: 'Borrowing From the Future: An Attempt to Address Double Sampling'
abstract: For model-free reinforcement learning, one of the main challenges of stochastic
  Bellman residual minimization is the double sampling problem, i.e., while only one
  single sample for the next state is available in the model-free setting, two independent
  samples for the next state are required in order to perform unbiased stochastic
  gradient descent. We propose new algorithms for addressing this problem based on
  the idea of borrowing extra randomness from the future. When the transition kernel
  varies slowly with respect to the state, it is shown that the training trajectory
  of new algorithms is close to the one of unbiased stochastic gradient descent. Numerical
  results for policy evaluation in both tabular and neural network settings are provided
  to confirm the theoretical findings.
