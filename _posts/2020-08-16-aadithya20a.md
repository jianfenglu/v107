title: Data-driven Compact Models for Circuit  Design and Analysis
abstract: 'Compact semiconductor device models are essential for efficiently designing
  and analyzing large circuits. However, traditional compact model development requires
  a large amount of manual effort and can span many years. Moreover, inclusion of
  new physics (\eg{}, radiation effects) into an existing model is not trivial and
  may require redevelopment from scratch. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the
  potential to automate and significantly speed up the development of compact models.
  In addition, ML provides a range of modeling options that can be used to develop
  hierarchies of compact models tailored to specific circuit design stages. In this
  paper, we explore three such options: (1) table-based interpolation, (2) Generalized
  Moving Least-Squares, and (3) feed-forward Deep Neural Networks, to develop compact
  models for a p-n junction diode. We evaluate the performance of these “data-driven”
  compact models by (1) comparing their voltage-current characteristics against laboratory
  data, and (2) building a bridge rectifier circuit using these devices, predicting
  the circuit’s behavior using SPICE-like circuit simulations, and then comparing
  these predictions against laboratory measurements of the same circuit.  '
