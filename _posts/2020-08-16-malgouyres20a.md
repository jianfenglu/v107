title: On the stable recovery of deep structured linear networks under sparsity constraints
abstract: " We consider a deep structured linear network under sparsity constraints.
  We study sharp conditions guaranteeing the stability of the optimal parameters defining
  the network. More precisely, we provide sharp conditions on the network architecture
  and the sample under which the error on the parameters defining the network scales
  linearly with the reconstruction error (i.e. the risk). Therefore, under these conditions,
  the weights obtained with a successful algorithms are well defined and only depend
  on the architecture of the network and the sample. The features in the latent spaces
  are stably defined. The stability property is required in order to interpret the
  features defined in the latent spaces. It can also lead to a guarantee on the statistical
  risk. This is what motivates this study. The analysis is based on the recently proposed
  Tensorial Lifting. The particularity of this paper is to consider a sparsity prior.
  This leads to a better stability constant. As an illustration, we detail the analysis
  and provide sharp stability guarantees for convolutional linear network under sparsity
  prior. In this analysis, we distinguish the role of the network architecture and
  the sample input. This highlights the requirements on the data in connection to
  parameter stability.  "
