title: 'DP-LSSGD: A Stochastic Optimization Method to Lift the Utility in Privacy-Preserving
  ERM'
abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained by differentially private stochastic
  gradient descent (DP-SGD) have much lower utility than the non-private ones. To
  mitigate this degradation, we propose a DP Laplacian smoothing SGD (DP-LSSGD) to
  train ML models with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. At the core of DP-LSSGD
  is the Laplacian smoothing, which smooths out the Gaussian noise used in the Gaussian
  mechanism. Under the same amount of noise used in the Gaussian mechanism, DP-LSSGD
  attains the same DP guarantee, but in practice, DP-LSSGD makes training both convex
  and nonconvex ML models more stable and enables the trained models to generalize
  better. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement and the extra computational
  complexity and memory overhead compared with DP-SGD are negligible. DP-LSSGD is
  applicable to train a large variety of ML models, including DNNs. The code is available
  at \url{https://github.com/BaoWangMath/DP-LSSGD}.
