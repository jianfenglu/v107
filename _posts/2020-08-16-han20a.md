title: Deep Fictitious Play for Finding Markovian Nash Equilibrium in Multi-Agent
  Games
abstract: We propose a deep neural network-based algorithm to identify the Markovian
  Nash equilibrium of general large $N$-player stochastic differential games. Following
  the idea of fictitious play, we recast the $N$-player game into $N$ decoupled decision
  problems (one for each player) and solve them iteratively. The individual decision
  problem is characterized by a semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, to solve
  which we employ the recently developed deep BSDE method. The resulted algorithm
  can solve large $N$-player games for which conventional numerical methods would
  suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Multiple numerical examples involving identical
  or heterogeneous agents, with risk-neutral or risk-sensitive objectives, are tested
  to validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in large group games. Even for
  a fifty-player game with the presence of common noise, the proposed algorithm still
  finds the approximate Nash equilibrium accurately, which, to our best knowledge,
  is difficult to achieve by other numerical algorithms.
